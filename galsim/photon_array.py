PhotonArray.__doc__ = """
The PhotonArray class encapsulates the concept of a collection of photons incident on
a detector.

A PhotonArray object is not typically constructed directly by the user.  Rather, it is
typically constructed as the return value of the `GSObject.shoot` method.
At this point, the photons only have x,y,flux values.  Then there are a number of classes
that perform various modifications to the photons such as giving them wavelengths or
inclination angles or removing some due to fringing or vignetting.

TODO: fringing, vignetting, and angles are not implemented yet, but we expect them to
be implemented soon, so the above paragraph is a bit aspirational atm.

Attributes
----------

A PhotonArray instance has the following attributes, each of which is a numpy array:

- x,y           the incidence positions at the top of the detector
- flux          the flux of the photons
- dxdz, dydz    the tangent of the inclination angles in each direction
- wavelength    the wavelength of the photons

Unlike most GalSim objects (but like Images), PhotonArrays are mutable.  It is permissible
to write values to the above attributes with code like

    >>> photon_array.x += numpy.random.random(1000) * 0.01
    >>> photon_array.flux *= 20.
    >>> photon_array.wavelength = sed.sampleWavelength(photonarray.size(), bandpass)
    etc.

All of these will update the existing numpy arrays being used by the photon_array instance.

Note about the flux attribute
-----------------------------

Normal photons have flux=1, but we allow for "fat" photons that combine the effect of several
photons at once for efficiency.  Also, some profiles need to use negative flux photons to properly
implement photon shooting (e.g. InterpolateImage, which uses negative flux photons to get the
interpolation correct).  Finally, when we "remove" photons, for better efficiency, we actually
just set the flux to 0 rather than recreate new numpy arrays.

Initialization
--------------

The initialization constructs a PhotonArray to hold N photons, but does not set the values of
anything yet.  The constructor allocates space for the x,y,flux arrays, since those are always
needed.  The other arrays are only allocated on demand if the user accesses these attributes.

@param N            The number of photons to store in this PhotonArray.  This value cannot be
                    changed.
@param x            Optionally, the initial x values. [default: None]
@param y            Optionally, the initial y values. [default: None]
@param flux         Optionally, the initial flux values. [default: None]
@param dxdz         Optionally, the initial dxdz values. [default: None]
@param dydz         Optionally, the initial dydz values. [default: None]
@param wavelength   Optionally, the initial wavelength values. [default: None]
